## How to Use

Just head over to [BGQuickstart.com](https://bgquickstart.com), choose how many players, and start playing!

## Why

I built this app because the available options for choosing a start player when playing board games didn't do what I wanted them to do: Pick a player quickly so we can start playing.

## Tech

BGQuickstart is built and deployed automatically by Netlify whenever changes are pushed to the master branch here on GitHub. It uses Create-React-App with Typescript and Service Workers enabled. The ui was built using Tailwind CSS with a custom color scheme.
